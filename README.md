### Requiremnts
The only requirement is [tinycolor.js](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) which is an exceptional color manipulation library.

### Disclaimer
This is still in a very early beta, and is rappidly changing (3 versions before initial commit).  I am open to any and all help anyone is willing to put in.  Will update as we go.


##### Known issues / TODO
- Prevent focus from opening color picker on window/tab activation.
- Focus on preview input when user starts typing
